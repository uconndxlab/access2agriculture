## Vuetify

This project uses Vuetify for UI components, layouts, etc.

[https://vuetifyjs.com/](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

There is a lot to this documentation, but the Styles & Animations and UI Components sections probably have most of what you need to get started.  You can mostly drop in their examples and start going from there.
